TODOs
=====
* Log and Repositories View: _Show x entries_ will always reset to 10 after each page reload (Tested on Firefox 51.0.1 and Internet Explorer 11)

Done
====
* Highlight selected Repository in navigation tree
* Remove horizontal scrollbar on bottom of tables
* Format Timestamps in user interface
* Implement search of Repositories in UI and expand the matched groups
* Make date range selection filter work
* Clear the repostiory search string and reload the data
* Make left menu navbar to have a fixed width
* Prettify log.html search input fields (make 2 or 3 columns for input fields)
* Log view: search on pressing return
* Model fields Action and Stage as Dropdowns which can be overwritten
* Remember filter if collapsing and expanding repository group
* Status records are missing when filtering by repo name
* Pack client-side libs with application, minify resources

Improvements
============
* Use bookmarkable URLs
* Introduce DTOs instead of serializing the entities directly to JSON
* Make separate REST Resources for Datatables because of ugly multidimensional params
* Show number of filtered and total Repositories in group
